# human-reaction-test-vhdl
Use an FPGA to code the logic for a human reaction time to the blinking of a light. This was Archie and Dakin myself coding a human reaction test with VHDL on Nexsys4. We had each other during development; good brainstorming sessions. Doughlas Agho joined only helped with docs.

This [video](demo/vhdl-demo.mp4) shows you the end result. Schematics [here](rtl_schematic.pdf). Test bench and simulations [here](./Schematics/). [Nexys-4-DDR-Master.xdc](./Nexys-4-DDR-Master.xdc) is the constraint file for the Nexys4 DDR.
